# Novation Remote SL MkI & MkII

Support script for Novation's Remote MkII controller. You can control track parameters, devices, transport, play the pads, start scenes and a step sequencer.

## Installation

* If you added the controller manually, choose the 2nd MIDI port of the device as in-/output. Select the first port as the 2nd input.

## Introduction

The Transport button acts as a kind of Shift key. If you press it (no need to keep pressed) the behaviour of the Transport buttons changes slightly and you can switch between Control and Play mode. To switch mode use the first row buttons.
Use the P1 buttons to access several menus of a specific row.

Notes for the **ZeRO SL MkII**:

* The script also supports this model
* The P1 up/down buttons are the Page left/right buttons on the ZeRO
* The P2 up/down buttons are the Page left/right buttons with keeping the Preview button pressed at the same time on the ZeRO
* To switch the display to a specific row keep the Preview button pressed and press a button on the row.
* The Crossfader is the same as the X-axis of the Touchpad and therefore can be configured with the Touchpad settings.
