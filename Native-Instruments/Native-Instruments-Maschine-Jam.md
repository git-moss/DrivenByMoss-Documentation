## Preferences Settings

You can set several preferences which are stored when you exit the DAW. These are global settings and not specific to projects.

### Transport

* Record button: Set the function for the record button.
* Shift + Record button: Set the function for the record button used in combination with Shift.
* Behaviour on Pause: Sets the action to be executed when playback is stopped with the Play button

### Play and Sequence

* Quantize Amount: The amount of quantization to use when Quantize is executed. 100% alignes all notes fully to the grid.
* Default note view: The view that should be the default when you select an instrument track for the first time (e.g. Play, Drum, Sequencer, ...).
* Start with session view: Enables the session view on startup if active otherwise the default note view is displayed.

### Session

* Select clip/scene on launch: If a clip/scene is started from the controller and this setting is off the clip/scene will not be selected. Use if you edit another clip and want not to change the focus.
* Action for pressing rec armed empty clip: what should happen if you press an empty clip in the session mode.
* Display clips of record enabled tracks in red: if enabled, in the session view for record enabled tracks the empty pads are displayed in red.
* Flip Session: Toggle the session modes' orientation horizontal or vertical.

### Workflow

* Exclude deactivated items: If active, deactivated items like tracks will not be displayed on the controller. This cleans up the displayed banks but also prevents the options to activate an deactivated item from the controller.
* New clip length: The length of a clip created with the New function.
* Knob Sensitivity Default: Negative values slow the knobs changes down, positive values speed them up
* Knob Sensitivity Slow: Negative values slow the knobs changes down, positive values speed them up
* Footswitch settings: The Maschine Jam supports 2 footswitches. Since there is only 1 stereo connector, a double footswitch like a Boss FS-6 needs to be used. Select the function you want to assign to a footswitch from the drop down lists. The available functions should be self-explanatory, except *Clip Based Looper*: this uses the currently selected MIDI clip slot. If it is empty, a new clip is created (depending on the *New clip length* setting above) and playback is started. As long as the footswitch is pressed overdub is activated. If the footswitch is released overdub is deactivated.

### Drum Sequencer

* Turn off empty drum pads: Empty drum cells are displayed in gray. If enabled the pad LEDs are off.

## Document Settings

### Scales

* Scale: Select the scale
* Base: Select the base note of the scale
* In Key: Select *Chromatic* to also display notes which are not part of the scale.

### Note Repeat

* Period: The repeat rate of the note repeat
* Length: The length of a repeated note
* Mode: The arpeggiator mode
