# Native Instruments Komplete Kontrol 2 S49, S61, S88, Komplete Kontrol A49, A61, M32

Support for Native Instruments Komplete Kontrol controllers, which use the NI Host Integration protocol.

Since Native Instruments Host Integration service is only available for Windows and Macos, **Linux is not supported**.

## Installation

Native Instruments Host Integration service must be installed and running. It is automatically the case
if you installed Komplete Kontrol on your machine.

1. Select the MIDI input and output ending with "DAW" as the first channel.
2. Select the MIDI input and output without an ending as the second.

## Features

The basic feature set is identical to Ableton Live as described in the respective Kontrol manuals.
Additionally, there are some settings to change the behaviour.

### Extended features

There are two additional modes for device parameters and send modes. **Toggle these modes with the CLEAR button.** (on the A/M-models use SHIFT+STOP).

### Send mode

* This mode controls 8 sends of the currently selected track.
* The volume and pan display represents the value of each send.
* The knobs below changes the send values (both in volume and pan mode).
* The bank left/right buttons switch between the sends 1-8 and 9-16 of the channel.
* The encoder left/right/up/down switch between the sends 1-8 and 9-16 of the channel as well.
* Select/Mute/Solo buttons always control the tracks.

### Device/parameters mode

* This mode controls 8 parameters.
* The volume and pan display represents the value of each parameter.
* The knobs below changes the parameter values (both in volume and pan mode).
* The bank left/right buttons switch between the devices of the channel (only S-Series).
* The encoder up/down switches between the devices of the channel as well.
* The encoder left/right switches between the parameter pages of the selected device.
* Pressing the encoder toggles the window of the selected device (if any).
* Select/Mute/Solo buttons always control the tracks

## Preferences Settings

You can set several preferences which are stored when you exit the DAW. These are global settings and not specific to projects.

### Transport

* Behaviour on Stop: Sets the action to be executed when playback is stopped with the Stop button
* Behaviour on Pause: Sets the action to be executed when playback is stopped with the Play button
* Record button: Select the function of the record button.
* Shift + Record button: Select the function of the record button when used in combination with the Shift key.

### Navigation

* Flip track/clip navigation: Flips the direction (previous/next) if enabled
* Flip clip/scene navigation: Flips the direction (previous/next) if enabled

### Workflow

* Exclude deactivated items: If active, deactivated items like tracks will not be displayed on the controller. This cleans up the displayed banks but also prevents the options to activate an deactivated item from the controller.
* New clip length: The length of a clip created with the New function.
* Knob Speed Normal: Adjust the speed of the knobs
* Knob Speed Slow: Adjust the speed of the knobs when used with Shift for fine adjustments
