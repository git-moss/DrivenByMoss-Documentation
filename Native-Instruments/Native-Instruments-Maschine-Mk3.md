# Native Instruments Maschine Mk2 / Mk3 / Maschine+ / Studio

Support for Native Instruments Maschine Mk2, Mk3, Maschine+ and Maschine Studio.

Since the extension requires the Native Instruments Host Integration service it **only works on Windows and Mac (no Linux)**.

## Installation

Load the respective template from the matching folder _resources/Maschine Mk2_, _resources/Maschine Mk3_, _resources/Maschine+_ or _resources/Maschine Studio_ into the device by using Native Instruments Controller Editor.

**Important**: Selecting the template is a bit tricky since when you activate a template from the Maschine which overwrites the left/right buttons you are stuck with the template list on the display. Therefore, you need to select the template from the controller editor. If you are already stuck in the template list do the following to fix it:

1. Open the controller editor.
2. Select a template which does not overwrite the left/right button
3. On the Maschine press Shift and select *Knobs* with the button over the 2nd display to move away from the template list
4. Select the DrivenByMoss template in the controller editor.

## Important notes

This extension uses the MIDI mode of the device. Press **Shift+CHANNEL** (on the left / top) buttons to enter MIDI mode. On the Mk2 it is **Shift+CONTROL**.

## Differences between the models

The Mk3 and Maschine+ are identical (besides some slight label changes).

### Mk2

The Mk2 misses some buttons of the Mk3. The differences are as follows:

* The SHIFT button is not working in MIDI mode on the Mk2. The *STEP LEFT* button (above the REC button) is used as both a replacement of the STOP and SHIFT button.
* The Page left / right buttons cannot be used in MIDI mode. Use NAVIGATE and pads instead (see below).
* The *STEP RIGHT* button (above the ERASE button) is the *TAP TEMPO/METRO* button.
* 4D-Encoder left/right: Use the 2 arrows below the encoder.
* 4D-Encoder up/down: Use the 2 arrows below the encoder with Shift (STEP LEFT).
* The *Lock* button is the *Enter* button on Mk2.
* The *File/Save* button is the *All/Save* button on Mk2.
* The *Auto* button is the *Auto Wr* button on Mk2.
* The *Follow/Grid* button is the *Grid* button on Mk2.
* The 4 buttons above the pads of the Mk3 are missing (PAD MODE, KEYBOARD, CHORDS, STEP): PAD MODE can be found left of the pads, use Shift+PAD MODE for KEYBOARD, CHORDS does not have a replacement, STEP is found on the top/left next to the CONTROL button.
* The *Events* button is replaced by pressing the *STEP LEFT + Select/Events* button on Mk2.

### Studio

The Maschine Studio misses some buttons of the Mk3 but also adds new features. The differences are as follows:

* The SHIFT button is not working in MIDI mode on the Maschine Studio. Therefore, the *BACK* button (in the Edit section) is used instead.
* The Page left / right buttons cannot be used in MIDI mode. Use NAVIGATE and pads instead (see below).
* 4D-Encoder left/right: Use the 2 function arrows below the encoder.
* 4D-Encoder up/down: Use the 2 function arrows below the encoder with Shift (BACK).
* *Select+2 function arrows* select the previous/next device.
* There is no *Stop* button on the Maschine Studio use the Play Button instead.
* The *Lock* button is the *Enter* button on the Maschine Studio.
* The *File/Save* button is the *All/Save* button on the Maschine Studio.
* The *Follow/Grid* button is the *Grid* button on Maschine Studio.
* The 4 buttons above the pads are missing (PAD MODE, KEYBOARD, CHORDS, STEP): PAD MODE can be found left of the pads, use Shift+PAD MODE for KEYBOARD, CHORDS does not have a replacement, STEP is found on the left next to the TAP button.

The Maschine Studio provides some additional buttons and features:

* **METRO** - Toggles the metronome.
* **Shift+METRO** - Toggles the *Play Ticks* option.
* **COPY** - Not used.
* **PASTE** - Not used.
* **NOTE** - Transpose the selected MIDI clip a semitone up.
* **Shift+NOTE** - Transpose the selected MIDI clip a semitone down.
* **NUDGE** - Transpose the selected MIDI clip an octave up.
* **Shift+NUDGE** - Transpose the selected MIDI clip an octave down.
* **UNDO** - Undo.
* **REDO** - Redo.
* **QUANTIZE** - Quantize the selected MIDI clip 100%.
* **Shift+QUANTIZE** - Quantize the selected MIDI clip 50%.
* **CLEAR** - Deletes all MIDI notes from the selected MIDI clip.

**Metering Section**

The level meter displays the VU of the master track except when GRP is selected then the VU of the selected track is displayed.

Since the LED strips do always display the value of the knob when turned, the VU cannot be used together with the knob.
Therefore, there are two modes: *VU mode*, in which the knob is deactivated and the *parameter mode* where the knob is active and the LED strips display the value of the selected parameter. The IN3 button toggles between the 2 modes.
Another limitation of the MIDI mode is that even if there are 2 LED strips, you can only address them as one strip and both show the same value.

The parameter controlled by the encoder knob is set with the 8 buttons above it:

* **MST** - Activates changing the volume of the master track.
* **IN1** - Activates changing the panorama of the master track.
* **GRP** - Activates changing the volume of the selected track.
* **IN2** - Activates changing the panorama of the selected track.
* **SND** - Activates changing the metronome volume.
* **IN3** - Toggles VU meters and value control.
* **CUE** - Activates changing the cue volume.
* **IN4** - Activates changing the cue mix.

Use the encoder in combination with **SHIFT** for slower changes.

## Preferences Settings

You can set several preferences which are stored when you exit the DAW. These are global settings and not specific to projects.

### Transport

* Record button: Set the function for the record button.
* Shift + Record button: Set the function for the record button used in combination with Shift.
* Behaviour on Pause: Sets the action to be executed when playback is stopped with the Play button.

### Play and Sequence

* Activate Fixed Accent: If a note is played the velocity is ignored and a fixed value is used.
* Fixed Accent Value: The velocity value to use when fixed accent is active.
* Quantize Amount: The amount of quantization to use when Quantize is executed. 100% aligns all notes fully to the grid.
* Ribbon Mode: Select the function of the ribbon strip.
* Turn off scale pads: If enabled, all pads which represent notes which are in-scale are switched off (instead of white).

### Session

* Select clip/scene on launch: If a clip/scene is started from the controller and this setting is off the clip/scene will not be selected. Use if you edit another clip and want not to change the focus.
* Action for pressing rec armed empty clip: what should happen if you press an empty clip in the session view.

### Workflow

* Exclude deactivated items: If active, deactivated items like tracks will not be displayed on the controller. This cleans up the displayed banks but also prevents the options to activate a deactivated item from the controller.
* New clip length: The length of a clip created with the New function.
* Knob Sensitivity Default: Negative values slow the knobs changes down, positive values speed them up.
* Knob Sensitivity Slow: Negative values slow the knobs changes down, positive values speed them up.
* Footswitch settings: The Maschine models Mk3 and Plus support 2 and the Studio 4 footswitches. Since there is only 1 (or 2 on Studio) stereo connector, a double footswitch like a Boss FS-6 needs to be used. Select the function you want to assign to a footswitch from the drop down list. The available functions should be self-explanatory, except *Clip Based Looper*: this uses the currently selected MIDI clip slot. If it is empty, a new clip is created (like using the Macro button) and playback is started. As long as the footswitch is pressed overdub is activated. If the footswitch is released overdub is deactivated.

### Pads

* Convert Poly Aftertouch to: The pads support poly aftertouch. If the device you play does not support this option allows to change it to Channel Aftertouch or a MIDI CC command.

## Document Settings

These settings are specific to each project.

### Scales

* Scale: Select the scale.
* Base: Select the base note of the scale.
* In Key: Select *Chromatic* to also display notes which are not part of the scale.
* Layout: Select the layout of the scale for the Play mode. The numbers are the offsets between the rows of the grid. The arrows depict the direction from lower to higher notes: left to right or bottom to top.

### Note Repeat

* Active: Enable note repeat.
* Period: The repeat rate of the note repeat.
* Length: The length of a repeated note.
* Mode: The arpeggiator mode.
* Octave: The octave range which is used by the arpeggiator.
