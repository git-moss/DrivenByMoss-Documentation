# Gamepad

Supports several Gamepad controllers, e.g. from XBox.

## Installation

The Gamepad controller support needs to be added manually. Open the controller settings and click on *Add controller*, select *Generic*, and then *Gamepad* from the list. After that, select one input MIDI input. The MIDI input is necessary to send MIDI data to the DAW. It should not be used by anything else, best bet is to use/create a virtual MIDI input.

Make sure your gamepad is connected before starting the DAW. If not, press the Refresh button after connecting the gamepad (in Reaper it is necessary to close and reopen the dialog to make the gamepad list appear). Finally, select your gamepad from the list.

## Configuration

The settings show several controls of the gamepad (buttons and continuous controls, called 'axis'). For each of the controls you can select a function to execute. Some functions are marked to be only available for buttons or axis controls. For controls not present on the selected controller the selection list is greyed out.
